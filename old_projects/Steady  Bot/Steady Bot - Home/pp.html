        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01.09.2024</p>

        <p>Thank you for using <strong>Steady</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our Discord bot ("the Bot") on your servers.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Links:</strong> We store links to the Discord servers where the Bot is added.</li>
            <li><strong>User List:</strong> We collect and store information about the members of your Discord server, including usernames and user IDs.</li>
            <li><strong>User Permissions:</strong> We store the permissions of users on your server to ensure the Bot's commands function correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is essential for the operation of the Bot. Without this data, the Bot cannot function correctly, and the intended commands will not work.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We share the collected data with the Discord team as necessary to ensure the Bot's proper functioning and to comply with Discord's terms of service.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Currently, we do not implement specific security measures to protect the data we collect. Users should be aware that data is stored without encryption or other forms of protection.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your data only for as long as the Bot is active on your server. Once the Bot is removed, all associated data will be deleted.</p>

        <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
        <p>If you wish to have your data removed or have any questions about our data practices, please remove the Bot from your server, which will result in the deletion of your data.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us through our Discord server: <a href="https://discord.gg/5WXKe95S3m">https://discord.gg/5WXKe95S3m</a>.</p>
